Last Changes is a *Jenkin plugin* that shows `rich` *Git* diffs between builds.

== Introduction

The main idea behind the plugin is to easily find the `root cause` of a *failling build*.


== How it works?

. The plugin expects that your builds are triggered by a SCM change (git push);
. After the change your job will be run;
. The diff between `actual` and `previous` change will be stored on your job;
. The *git diff* for each build can be viewed later, here is a sample:   

NOTE: The diff history is stored for _N_ build where _N_ is setup on the job.

== Usage

After instalation just activate the post build action named *Publish Last Changes*. 

== Configuration

For now the only configuration is the number of diffs to store.
