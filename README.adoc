Last Changes is a *Jenkin plugin* that shows `rich` *git* diffs between builds.

== Introduction

The plugin uses https://diff2html.rtfpessoa.xyz/[diff2html^] to show last changes of a given build, example:

Or using side-by-side configuration:

NOTE: Last changes means `compare current revision with previous one`.

One of the objectives of this plugin is to easily find the `root cause` of a *failling build*.

Also another area that the plugin can help is in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery[*Continuous Delivery*^] where each _commit_ generates a release candidate. In this case the plugin will show what has changed on a possible release.


== How it works?

. The plugin expects that your builds are triggered by a SCM change (git push);
. After the change your job will be run;
. The diff between `actual` and `previous` change will be stored on your build;
. The *git diff* for each build can be viewed later


== Usage

After installation just activate the post build action named *Publish Last Changes*.
